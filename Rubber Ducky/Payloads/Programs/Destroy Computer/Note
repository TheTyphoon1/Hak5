Silent is the better option. It minimises the cmd window after running the commands and takes less than 3 seconds.

Loud does the same but then also uses "taskkill /f /im “explorer.exe”" to close the desktop and taskbar 
leaving you with a black screen or your accent colour which by default is blue and whatever apps you had open at that time.
It then minimises all windows so it cannot be fixed except by alt tabbing or shutting down the computer.
